-  Enhanced background graphics in the game background, winning scene, and losing scene

Our game Connections is played on a 4 by 4 tile grid in which each tile contains a word.
The player must select four words to which they believe share some commonality, in an attempt
to guess the correct word group. There are four correct word groups, each with four corresponding 
words. A player starts the game with four lives, if the four words they selected do not match any of
the answer groups, the player loses a life. If the player loses all their lives, they lose the game.
If the player is able to guess all four answer groups before they lose all lives, they win the game.
Additionally, the player has the option to de-select all selected tiles at the moment by clicking the 
"d" key, to re-shuffle the remaining tiles on the board by clicking the "s" key, and to reset
the entire game by clicking the "r" key.
